👋 Hi, I’m Jakub Zajda aka @Belijder

I have 2 years of experience in developing software for iOS. I’m a self-taught. During my studies I used online courses and articles as well as language documentation. I am looking for a job where I can develop and expand my skills. I am very ambitious and hard-working. I’m a fast-learner, able to work in a team and I have highly advanced communication skills.

## experience
Right now I have two apps in my portfolio. These are applications that were written 100% by me from the start. They are not projects created during boodcamp learning or a tutorial clone.

##
### The Movie App
An application that uses the TMDB database, which allows users to browse, search and save movies. In addition, the app recommends movies to watch based on the user’s favorite movies and actors.

Used: Swift, SwiftUI, Swift Concurrency, Combine, Core Data, REST API, MVVM, Dependency injection

##

### The Dice Game
A digital version of the popular ancient game for 2-4 players, where players toss five cubic dice to obtain certain combinations for which points are
collected.

Used: Swift, SwiftUI, MVVM design pattern

I am currently starting a new project in which I am also using Firebase,
MapKit and UIKit.
