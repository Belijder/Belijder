👋 Hi, I’m Jakub Zajda aka @Belijder

I have two years of experience in developing software for iOS. I’m a self-taught. During my studies I used online courses and articles as well as language documentation. I'm looking for a job where I can develop and expand my skills. I am very ambitious and hard-working. Furthermore, I’m a fast-learner, able to work in a team, and I have highly advanced communication skills.

## experience
Right now I have three apps in my portfolio. Two of them are available for download in the AppStore. These are applications that were written 100% by me from the start. They are not projects created during boodcamp learning or a tutorial clone.

##
## Mapa Murali
My latest, most extensive and refined application in which users, after creating an account, can browse, rate and add photos of murals in urban space.

Used: Swift, UIKit, AutoLayout, MapKit, RxSwift, Firebase, MVVM, Dependency injection, Geolocation, Custom transition

Link to AppStore: [HERE](https://apps.apple.com/pl/app/mapa-murali/id1659498483?l=pl&fbclid=IwAR21n_6PjS4aPPRHEJIUWErd7SnrLpUYvaLrImZmgRsNaifHunaf62rlVsU)

### The Movie App
An application that uses the TMDB database, which allows users to browse, search and save movies. In addition, the app recommends movies to watch based on the user’s favorite movies and actors.

In this project I focused on trying to imitate the UI from an existing IMDb application.

Used: Swift, SwiftUI, Swift Concurrency, Combine, Core Data, REST API, MVVM, Dependency injection

### The Dice Game
A digital version of the popular ancient game for 2-4 players, where players toss five cubic dice to obtain certain combinations for which points are
collected.

Used: Swift, SwiftUI, MVVM design pattern
